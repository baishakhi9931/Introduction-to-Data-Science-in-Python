# Assignment 2 - Pandas Introduction
All questions are weighted the same in this assignment.
## Part 1
The following code loads the olympics dataset (olympics.csv), which was derrived from the Wikipedia entry on [All Time Olympic Games Medals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table), and does some basic data cleaning. 

The columns are organized as # of Summer games, Summer medals, # of Winter games, Winter medals, total # number of games, total # of medals. Use this dataset to answer the questions below.

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('olympics.csv', index_col=0, skiprows=1)

for col in df.columns:
    if col[:2]=='01':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Gold'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:2]=='02':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Silver'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:2]=='03':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Bronze'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:1]=='â„–':
        df.rename(columns={col:'#'+col[1:]}, inplace=True)

names_ids = df.index.str.split('\s\(') # split the index by '('

df.index = names_ids.str[0] # the [0] element is the country name (new index) 
df['ID'] = names_ids.str[1].str[:3] # the [1] element is the abbreviation or ID (take first 3 characters from that)

df = df.drop('Totals')
df.head()

### Question 0 (Example)

What is the first country in df?

*This function should return a Series.*

# You should write your whole answer within the function provided. The autograder will call
# this function and compare the return value against the correct solution value
def answer_zero():
    # This function returns the row for Afghanistan, which is a Series object. The assignment
    # question description will tell you the general format the autograder is expecting
    return df.iloc[0]

# You can examine what your function returns by calling it in the cell. If you have questions
# about the assignment formats, check out the discussion forums for any FAQs
answer_zero() 

### Question 1
Which country has won the most gold medals in summer games?

*This function should return a single string value.*

def answer_one():
    a=max(df['Gold'])
    ans=df[df['Gold']==a].index.tolist()
    return ans[0]
answer_one()


### Question 2
Which country had the biggest difference between their summer and winter gold medal counts?

*This function should return a single string value.*

def answer_two():
    return df[(df['Gold'] - df['Gold.1']) == max(df['Gold'] - df['Gold.1'])].index.values[0]
answer_two()

### Question 3
Which country has the biggest difference between their summer gold medal counts and winter gold medal counts relative to their total gold medal count? 

$$\frac{Summer~Gold - Winter~Gold}{Total~Gold}$$

Only include countries that have won at least 1 gold in both summer and winter.

*This function should return a single string value.*

def answer_three():
    df_gold=df[(df['Gold']>0)&(df['Gold.1']>0)]
    df_diff=(abs(df_gold['Gold']-df_gold['Gold.1'])/df_gold['Gold.2'])
    return df_diff.idxmax()
answer_three()

### Question 4
Write a function that creates a Series called "Points" which is a weighted value where each gold medal (`Gold.2`) counts for 3 points, silver medals (`Silver.2`) for 2 points, and bronze medals (`Bronze.2`) for 1 point. The function should return only the column (a Series object) which you created, with the country names as indices.

*This function should return a Series named `Points` of length 146*

def answer_four():
    Points = pd.Series((df['Gold.2']*3) + (df['Silver.2']*2) + (df['Bronze.2']*1))
    return Points
answer_four()

## Part 2
For the next set of questions, we will be using census data from the [United States Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov). Counties are political and geographic subdivisions of states in the United States. This dataset contains population data for counties and states in the US from 2010 to 2015. [See this document](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/file-layouts/2010-2015/co-est2015-alldata.pdf) for a description of the variable names.

The census dataset (census.csv) should be loaded as census_df. Answer questions using this as appropriate.

### Question 5
Which state has the most counties in it? (hint: consider the sumlevel key carefully! You'll need this for future questions too...)

*This function should return a single string value.*

census_df= pd.read_csv('census.csv')
census_df.head()

def answer_five():
    return census_df.groupby(['STNAME']).size().idxmax()
answer_five()

### Question 6
**Only looking at the three most populous counties for each state**, what are the three most populous states (in order of highest population to lowest population)? Use `CENSUS2010POP`.

*This function should return a list of string values.*

def answer_six():
    result = census_df.copy()
    result = result.reset_index()
    result = result[result['SUMLEV'] == 50]
    columns_to_keep = ['STNAME', 'CENSUS2010POP']
    result = result[columns_to_keep]
    result = result.sort_values(['STNAME','CENSUS2010POP'], ascending=False)
    result = result.groupby('STNAME').head(3)
    result = result.groupby("STNAME").sum().sort_values('CENSUS2010POP', ascending=False).reset_index()
    result = list(result['STNAME'].loc[:2])
    return result

answer_six()

### Question 7
Which county has had the largest absolute change in population within the period 2010-2015? (Hint: population values are stored in columns POPESTIMATE2010 through POPESTIMATE2015, you need to consider all six columns.)

e.g. If County Population in the 5 year period is 100, 120, 80, 105, 100, 130, then its largest change in the period would be |130-80| = 50.

*This function should return a single string value.*

def answer_seven():
    result = census_df.copy()
    result = result.reset_index()
    result = result[result['SUMLEV'] == 50]
    cols_to_use = ['POPESTIMATE2010', 
                   'POPESTIMATE2011',
                   'POPESTIMATE2012',
                   'POPESTIMATE2013',
                   'POPESTIMATE2014',
                   'POPESTIMATE2015']
    result['MinPop'] = result.loc[:, cols_to_use].min(axis=1)
    result['MaxPop'] = result.loc[:, cols_to_use].max(axis=1)
    result['PopDelta'] = result['MaxPop'] - result['MinPop']
    columns_to_keep = ['CTYNAME', 'PopDelta']
    result = result[columns_to_keep].sort_values('PopDelta', ascending=False).reset_index()
    result = result['CTYNAME'].loc[0]
    return result

answer_seven()

### Question 8
In this datafile, the United States is broken up into four regions using the "REGION" column. 

Create a query that finds the counties that belong to regions 1 or 2, whose name starts with 'Washington', and whose POPESTIMATE2015 was greater than their POPESTIMATE 2014.

*This function should return a 5x2 DataFrame with the columns = ['STNAME', 'CTYNAME'] and the same index ID as the census_df (sorted ascending by index).*

def answer_eight():
    coun=census_df[census_df['SUMLEV']==50]
    ans=coun[((coun['REGION']==1)|(coun['REGION']==2))&(coun['CTYNAME']=='Washington County')& (coun['POPESTIMATE2015']>coun['POPESTIMATE2014'])][['STNAME','CTYNAME']]
    return ans

answer_eight()
